      "explanation": "Feature representation dominates because predictive performance depends primarily on whether predictors encode the true underlying signal. No algorithm can recover signal that is absent from the feature space. The quality of feature engineering determines the upper bound of model performance, while algorithm choice only affects how close we get to that bound.",
